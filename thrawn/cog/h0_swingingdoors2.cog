# Jedi Knight Cog Script

# By Heinz Högel 5/98 for free use in add-on levels
#
# This script controls one or two winged rotating doors. To start open/close
# action, activate one out of two possibly linked switches or send a user0
# message to this cog.
#
# Parameters:
#
# Door0
# Door1           -  IDs of door things (one is optional).
#
# Switch0
# Switch1         -  Surfaces with switches on. These switches can activate opening
#                    and closing of the door wings. They are both displayed as activated
#                    as long as the doors are moving and then return to deactivated state.
#                    Both are optional (without them you have to send a user0 message to this
#                    cog to open/close the doors).
#
# Time            -  How long a complete door swing should last (in seconds). Should be positive
#                    on startup.
#
# AutoCloseDelay  -  If greater than 0.0, delay in seconds for automatic re-closing of doors.
