Misc. Author Info       : My name, If you did not already see it, is Jarrell 
			  Waggoner.  This is my first level.  I am 14, and 
			  I had a lot of fun making this level; 
			  so I hope you enjoy it.  My level has
			  multiple endings; so be sure to play it through
			  twice.  Don't bother playing it on easy unless you
			  are a beginner; it is way too easy.  If you want
			  a challenge, play it on hard.  I had a tough time
			  beating Thrawn on hard.  Oh yes, another thing-- 
			  there is a surprise person hidden in one of
			  the secret areas.  See if you can find him.

Description             : After Jerec's fall, the Rebels have gotten news
			  of a secret Imperial project, a cloning device, 
			  which was tested on Admiral Thrawn before he was
			  killed.  It is Kyle's job to destroy Thrawn's clone
			  before he reinvents the cloning device (which was
			  destroyed at the time of the second Death Star).
			  His mission will lead him to the center of a 
			  deadly star destroyer, The Centaur.

Known Bugs
-------------------
Serious Bugs:

1. Sometimes you will get stuck using the telporter in the Force Field Generator
   room.  If you do, you will have to restart or load a save.

2. If you load a save near the self-destruct room and then you press one of 
   the buttons, you might get kicked out of the game.

Not so serious Bugs:
1. Sometimes the Geosets in actor 3do's will change (look like stick figures).
   It sometimes happens to Kyle in the very end, and it happens to the other
   actors near Thrawn's ballroom.

2. In the detention center many of you will have real framerate problems.  
   If you are using an older system, your framerate will plummet almost to 0.
   I recomend that you have a newer system and a good 3d accelerator to use
   this level.

3. If you use anything less than 640X480 resolution then you might not be
   able to see the switches on the side of the main elevator.  If this happens
   you will either have to switch to a higher resolution or make your best
   guess about what which button does.

Install Instructions
------------------------
Warning: DO NOT PUT THE INCLUDED GOB IN THE EPISODE DIRECTORY OF YOUR
	 JEDI KNIGHT FOLDER. INSTEAD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW.

To install you have two options, the easy way and the hard way.

The Easy way: simply get Jedi Knight Patch Commander and put the included Gob
	      file in your JKPatch directory, under Jedi Knight.

The Hard way: Make a directory under your Jedi Knight directory called Thrawn.
	      Then put either the Phaser.gob or the Thrawn.gob in it. (Remember,
	      the Thrawn.gob is my level and has the phaser patch included in
	      it.  The Phaser.gob is the phaser patch that allows you to use
	      the phaser in levels other than mine.) After you put the gob
	      file in the directory, put the Thrawn.bat in your Jedi Knight
	      directory and click on it.  

Tips
-------------------
When fighting The Advanced Troopers:

1. Remember that they can't hear very well; so if they have their backs
   turned, you can sneak up on them.  

2. The light saber works well on the Advanced Rail Troops, but the rail detenator
   works best on the Advanced Repeater and Blaster Troops.

3. The Advanced Rail Troops shoot much faster on hard than they do on easy so be very
   careful not to let them see you.  If they do, then try to get as close to them
   as you can so they will stop shooting and start smacking you with their gun.
   That is the time to use your light saber on them.

When fighting Grand Admiral Thrawn's Clone:

1. He shoots very fast when you are far away, but when you come close he will
   blast you with a power phaser blast.

2. Always use your light saber against him because if you use any other weapon
   you will be vulnerable and not able to block, and he will kill you in a 
   second.

3. The key to fighting Thrawn is patience.  If you have your light saber out,
   just be patient and deflect all of his shots and eventualy he will die.

Phaser information:

1. Primary fire will shoot a very deadly orange blast using four (4) 
   power cells.

2. Secondary fire will shoot a green blast very quickly, but with little 
   damage.  It uses one (1) power cell.

3. The phaser replaces the crossbow.

Another note:
I have included another file in this Zip called phaser.gob.  It is the phaser 
weapon in gob format.  You can play other levels with the phaser if you use 
this patch.  My level has the phaser included, so if you load my level the hard
way, make sure you do not put phaser.gob in the same directory.  Only one or
the other.
